# Should systemd restart puma?
# Use "no" (the default) to ensure no interference when using
# stop/start/restart via `pumactl`.  The "on-failure" setting might
# work better for this purpose, but you must test it.
# Use "always" if only `systemctl` is used for start/stop/restart, and
# reconsider if you actually need the forking config.
